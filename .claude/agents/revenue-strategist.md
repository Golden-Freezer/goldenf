       - ads:
           web: AdSense ($0.10-0.30 RPM)

           native: Sponsored content
       - affiliate: 10-20% commission
       - data: Anonymous analytics (B2B)

     - "Coffee button" ($3 support)
   ```

2. **Platform-Specific Strategy**
   ```json
   {
     "web": {
       "payment": ["Stripe", "PayPal", "Crypto"],
       "ads": "AdSense banner + native",
       "conversion": "Exit intent popup"
     },
     "ios": {
       "payment": "In-App Purchase",
       "ads": "AdMob interstitial",
       "price_points": ["$0.99", "$4.99", "$9.99"]
     },
     "android": {
       "payment": "Google Play Billing",
       "ads": "AdMob rewarded video",
       "localized_pricing": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Ad Revenue Optimization**
   ```javascript
   // Ad placement strategy
   const adStrategy = {
     web: {
       above_fold: "728x90 leaderboard",
       in_content: "300x250 rectangle",
       sticky: "320x50 mobile anchor"
     },
     mobile: {
       app_open: "AdMob App Open",
       between_actions: "Interstitial (3min cooldown)",
       reward_boost: "Rewarded video for premium"
     },
     
     rules: [
       "Never interrupt core user flow",
       "Max 3 ads per session",
       "Premium users = no ads",
       "A/B test placements"
     ]

   - Localized pricing (purchasing power)
   ```
